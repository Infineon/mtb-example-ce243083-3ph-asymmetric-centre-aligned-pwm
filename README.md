# PSOC&trade; Control C1: 3-phase asymmetric centre-aligned PWM

This code example demonstrates generation of three-phase complementary PWM signals with dead-time insertion using CCU8 timer slices. The three phases (U, V, W) are started synchronously using global start control and run in center-aligned mode.

## Using the code example

### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*)

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target)

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Application(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**

      > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you

   b. Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box

      > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the application with the desired name "COMP_PWM" configured for the *KIT_PSC1M3_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_PSC1M3_EVK --app-id <app-id> --user-app-name COMP_PWM --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```


The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation


1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the debug USB connector


2. Open a terminal program and select the J-Link CDC COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program**
   </details>
   
      <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE

   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

   From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>


4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSOC C1 : 3-Phase Asymmetric Centre-Aligned PWM" message appears on UART terminal:

   **Figure 1. Terminal output on program startup**
   
   ![](images/terminal_print.png)

5. Verify on oscilloscope:

- Three complementary phase pairs: U, V, W
- Center-aligned PWM (period match = 2400)
- Duty alternates between 25% and 75%
- Duty update interval = 2500 us (every 50 PWM periods at 50 us period)
- Dead time configured to 48 timer ticks on both edges
- Synchronous phase start using global CCU trigger

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (JLink)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

### Peripheral configuration

The application initializes hardware with `cybsp_init()` and starts PWM slices by asserting global CCU start trigger in `main()`.

Three CCU8 slices are configured for U/V/W phase generation with complementary outputs and dead-time insertion.

The PWM compare values are updated in the CCU interrupt handler. An interrupt counter is used to toggle duty between 25% and 75% after every 50 interrupts.

### Timing setup

- Timer mode: center-aligned (count up/down)
- Period: 2400 ticks
- PWM period: 50 us
- Compare values: 600 ticks (75%) and 1800 ticks (25%)
- Duty toggle period: 2500 us using interrupt counter (`2500 / 50 = 50` interrupts)
- Prescaler: 1
- Tick time: 10 ns (`PWM_*_TICK_NS`)
- Dead time: 48 ticks (480 ns)
